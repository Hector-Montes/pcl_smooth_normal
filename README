This is an implementation of 

 *    SEGMENTATION OF POINT CLOUDS USING SMOOTHNESS CONSTRAINT
 *    by
 *    T. Rabbania, F. A. van den Heuvelb, G. Vosselmanc

It still needs to be cleaned up before it should be included in a larger
outside library system, but it should provide a good guide for an
implementation.


To use try:

cmake .
make
./bin/segment -i example_1.pcd -n 0.1 0.001
